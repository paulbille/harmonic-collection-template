      This page is the <mark>main page</mark> of your harmonic-collection. You
      could also call it <mark>index page</mark> because it indexes all your subpages (entries).
      You could also call it <mark>home or start page</mark> because of the location of this index file the browser will automatically open it.
      <mark>Your start/main/home page DOES NOT COUNT AS AN ENTRY!</mark>
    </p>

    <p>As a reminder, to pass this class your collection needs to have (at a minimum):
        <ul>
            <li>functioning links to all entries</li>
            <li>1 startpage like this one</li>
            <li>10 entries with at least 1 .html file per entry</li>
            <li>be responsive: work on mobile phones and desktops</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
